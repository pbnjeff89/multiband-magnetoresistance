# Multiband Magnetoresistance

Two- and three-band models for semiclassical metals.
Individual bands are assumed to be Drude metals, as per the definitions of resistivity and the Hall coefficient (Ashcroft & Mermin, 1.14, 1.15).
The two-band model is also in the Ashcroft & Mermin textbook but in chapter 12 problem 4b.
Deriving the three-band model can be found by extending the model and using Mathematica (or a similar CAS) to find the exact expression.

# Weak Antilocalization

Here is a model of conduction through a two-dimensional plane with spin-orbit coupling and random scatterers.
The model used here was found by [Hikami, Larkin, and Nagaoka](https://doi.org/10.1143/PTP.63.707).
